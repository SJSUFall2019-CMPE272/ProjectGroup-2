"Notes: Expenditures are adjusted for inflation using CPI-U for All Items. Homeowners with negative or non-reported income are included in the Under $40,000 category. White, black, Asian and multiracial householders are non-Hispanic. Hispanic householders may be of any race. Recent movers that don't know or refuse to say if they owned homes previously are included in Previous Owners category. Metro definitions for 1995-2013 are based on 1990 Office of Management and Budget boundaries, while 2015 boundaries were updated to 2013 OMB definitions and are thus not historically comparable. 2013 tabulations use JCHS-adjusted weights and 2015 tabulations use preliminary HUD weights. For more information about the re-weighting methodology, see http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/publications/emerging-trends-remodeling-market.
