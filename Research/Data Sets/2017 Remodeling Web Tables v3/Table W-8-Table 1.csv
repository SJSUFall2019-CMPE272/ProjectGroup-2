"Notes: Data includes the largest 50 metro areas ranked by population. See Table W-1 for definitions of discretionary and replacement projects. 2015 tabulations use preliminary HUD weights. Projected spending is the average of annual rates of change in sales of existing single-family homes (as of 2016:3) and starts of privately owned single-family homes (as of 2016:4). These inputs were obtained from Moody's Economy.com and estimated by Moody's Analytics based on data from the National Association of Realtors: Real Estate Outlook; CoreLogic, Inc.; and US Census Bureau, New Residential Construction.",,,,,,,,
