"Notes: The Economic Census does not report on nonpayroll businesses. JCHS estimates are based on the assumption that the distribution of nonpayroll businesses is comparable to that of payroll establishments by revenue size category. The residential remodeling share of all construction payroll establishments was calculated and these shares were applied to nonpayroll businesses within each of the revenue categories to estimate the number of nonpayroll remodeling businesses. The estimate of 491,000 nonpayroll remodelers was calculated by eliminating the 640,000 nonpayroll remodelers who reported less than $25,000 in gross receipts in 2012. Our procedures thus generate a conservative estimate of the number of businesses concentrating their activities in residential remodeling.",,,,,,
