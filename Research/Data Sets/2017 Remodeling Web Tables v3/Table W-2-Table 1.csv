"Notes: Homeowner numbers do not add to total because respondents may report projects in more than one category. Major remodels are defined as professional home improvements of more than $10,000 for kitchen projects and more than $5,000 for bath projects. Job categories are aggregations of the detailed projects reported in the AHS. Expenditures are adjusted for inflation using CPI-U for All Items. 2013 tabulations use JCHS-adjusted weights and 2015 tabulations use preliminary HUD weights. For more information about the re-weighting methodology, see www.jchs.harvard.edu/research/improving-americas-housing.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
