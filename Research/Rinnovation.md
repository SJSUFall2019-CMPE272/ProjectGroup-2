> At Opendoor, we buy and sell thousands of homes a month. The longer a home remains in our inventory, the more exposure we have to macroeconomic shifts. Moreover, property taxes, home financing, and maintenance fees all increase with time. These costs—which are sometimes referred to as “liquidity risk”—directly impact our unit economics. It is critical that we’re able to understand and predict how long a house will take to sell.
