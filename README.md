## Project Ideas

### 1

1. Title: Geoh
2. Description: See answers to your questions on a map.
3. Goal: Help politicians, scientists, and urban planners craft their messages from raw geographical data. They should have a tool for visualizing & predicting the impact of various factors (i.e. [air quality](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data), [fire incidents](https://fire.ca.gov/incidents/), etc.) on topics that matter to their audience: climate change, public health, and crime (to name just a few). The tool should enable a user to type a natural-language query (i.e. "How will air quality change in San Jos√© over the next 30 years?", "Which cities in California will need more firefighters in 5 years?") and see their answers on a map.
4. Technology: We intend to leverage a cloud-based service platform to deploy services and run machine learning workflows; leaning toward AWS. The team has experience in Scala, Java, and Python, so we will likely leverage those skills. For displaying maps, we will leverage an existing toolset (i.e. Mapbox, MapKit JS, etc.). We will focus on exploring new databases (i.e. time-series DBs, CockroachDB) and building our text-to-map NLP engine. We need help making decisions about how to architect the NLP workflows; any advice?
