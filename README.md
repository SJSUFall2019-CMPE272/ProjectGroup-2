## Project Ideas

### Rinnovation

#### Optimize your home renovation.

Guide homeowners toward renovations that will yield optimal results for their property. Whether the customer is focused on time, cost, or ROI, empower them to make the best decision based on local and global trends in renovations. Answer questions such as:
* Which room should I update?
* How much should I invest in a renovation project?
* Who should I trust to get the job done on-time?

There is existing work in this area. For instance, OpenDoor has a [tool that calculates which home improvements add the most value](https://www.opendoor.com/w/home-improvement-value-calculator). With the advent of *iBuyers* (corporations attempting to streamline real estate transactions), the demand for a tool which learns and recommends renovation trends in real-time has never been higher. Flush with venture capital, these corporations are able to make real estate purchases at high velocity and scale, thereby saving time and eliminating waste. However, once they have acquired properties, they have assumed a fair amount of risk. They need to optimize their processes to reduce temporal & fiscal costs associated with renovation. We aim to solve that problem.

> At Opendoor, we buy and sell thousands of homes a month. The longer a home remains in our inventory, the more exposure we have to macroeconomic shifts. Moreover, property taxes, home financing, and maintenance fees all increase with time. These costs—which are sometimes referred to as “liquidity risk”—directly impact our unit economics. It is critical that we’re able to understand and predict how long a house will take to sell.

### Solargy

#### Save Fossil. Save Money. Save Environment.

The US is the second-highest energy consumer in the world. More than 77% of the energy is produced by [fossil fuels](https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/what-are-major-sources-and-users-energy-united-states) (petroleum, natural gas, and coal), whereas only 1.66% is produced by [solar energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_States). Texas and California account for the most energy consumption in the country. Hot states like these have more than sufficient sunlight to transform it into energy. We will help consumers and businesses evaluate how much they will save financially over a given number of years. Moreover, we plan to motivate them by showing them how much their choices preserve the environment. We also plan to inform users if solar energy generation for some particular day will be lower than expected based on weather data, thereby helping users plan their consumption in advance (i.e. avoiding use of washing machine, dryer, etc.). Also we'll suggest the ways they could consume less energy.

### Ghar

#### A convenient way for people to decide their housing options.

We aim to improve house hunting. Finding housing that is affordable and close to work/school is a difficult task. We intend to build a tool that takes into consideration a user's priorities (i.e. money, time, location, school quality, and roommate criteria) and presents her with the most relevant options. Unlike other software, our tool will not pinpoint a particular house, rather it will locate all the possible areas where you can find the house with your desired options. Later we plan to map these locations based on various user preferences.
